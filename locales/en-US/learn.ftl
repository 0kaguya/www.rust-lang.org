learn-learn-rust = Learn Rust
learn-begin = Get started with Rust

learn-book = Affectionately nicknamed “the book,” <cite>The Rust Programming Language</cite> will give you an overview of the language from first principles. You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of the language.
learn-book-button = Read the Book!
learn-rustlings = Alternatively, Rustlings guides you through downloading and setting up the Rust toolchain, and teaches you the basics of reading and writing Rust syntax, on the command line. It's an alternative to Rust by Example that works with your own environment.
learn-rustlings-button = Do the Rustlings course!
learn-rbe = If reading multiple hundreds of pages about a language isn’t your style, then Rust By Example has you covered. While the book talks about code with a lot of words, RBE shows off a bunch of code, and keeps the talking to a minimum. It also includes exercises!
learn-rbe-button = Check out Rust by Example!

learn-use = Grow with Rust

learn-doc-heading = Read the core documentation
learn-doc = All of this documentation is also available locally using the <code>rustup doc</code> command, which will open up these resources for you in your browser without requiring a network connection!

learn-doc-std = Comprehensive guide to the Rust standard library APIs.
learn-doc-std-button = The standard 

learn-doc-edition = Guide to the Rust editions.
learn-doc-edition-button = Edition Guide

learn-doc-cargo = A book on Rust’s package manager and build system.
learn-doc-cargo-button = Cargo Book

learn-doc-rustdoc = Learn how to make awesome documentation for your crate.
learn-doc-rustdoc-button = rustdoc Book

learn-doc-rustc = Familiarize yourself with the knobs available in the Rust compiler.
learn-doc-rustc-button = rustc Book

learn-doc-error = In-depth explanations of the errors you may see from the Rust compiler.
learn-doc-error-button = Compiler Error Index


learn-domain = Build your skills in an application domain

learn-domain-cli-button = Command Line Book
learn-domain-cli = Learn how to build effective command line applications in Rust.

learn-domain-wasm-button = WebAssembly Book
learn-domain-wasm = Use Rust to build browser-native libraries through WebAssembly.

learn-domain-embedded-button = Embedded Book
learn-domain-embedded = Become proficient with Rust for Microcontrollers and other embedded systems.


learn-master = Master Rust
learn-master-text = Curious about the darkest corners of the language? Here’s where you can get into the nitty-gritty:


learn-reference-alt = A bookshelf icon
learn-reference = The Reference is not a formal spec, but is more detailed and comprehensive than the book.
learn-reference-button = Read the reference

learn-nomicon-alt = Two hands cradling fire
learn-nomicon = The Rustonomicon is your guidebook to the dark arts of unsafe Rust. It’s also sometimes called “the ’nomicon.”
learn-nomicon-button = Read the ’nomicon

learn-unstable-alt = A hand sharing sparkles
learn-unstable = The Unstable Book has documentation for unstable features that you can only use with nightly Rust.
learn-unstable-button = Read the unstable book
