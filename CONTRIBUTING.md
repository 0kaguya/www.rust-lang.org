# Contributing

A large open source website is a difficult thing to manage. This document will
explain much of the process that we will use while the site is still private.
As it develops, we'll also look to see how we can transition from private to
public. Please file an issue with suggestions!

**tl;dr: Always file an issue first.**

## Design and Content

Design and content are complicated thing, and many folks have lots of polarizing
feels about it. For the moment, large design changes are made exclusively by the
team (listed above). If you have concerns or thoughts for small changes, please
file an issue so that we can discuss it first!

### Design

The site currently uses two frameworks: [Tachyons] and [Skeleton].

The team is currently in the process of transitioning from Skeleton to Tachyons.
This is a somewhat complicated transition, so if you would like to update CSS,
please file an issue.

[@yoshuawuyts] and [@chriskrycho] are the current developers on this transition. Please
direct issues and questions to them!

### Content

The content of the site is currently overseen by [@aturon]. Please direct issues
and questions to him.

The content is largely owned by the associated team or working group. If you have
thoughts, it can be useful to discuss those with the lead(s) of those groups. You
can learn more about the teams and working groups on the Governance page of the
site.

## Development

Currently, [@ashleygwilliams] is the primary developer on the site. If
you need help or have any questions please direct them to [@ashleygwilliams].

Before filing a PR to the site, please file an issue. This way we can ensure that the
work you are doing meets the requirements of the site and will be very likely merged.
If you file a PR before an issue, you will likely be asked to file an issue, or your
PR may be closed outright.
