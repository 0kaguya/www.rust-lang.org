production-title = Rust in production
production-blurb = Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production
        today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know
        and love, like <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Firefox</a>,
        <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/">Dropbox</a>,
        and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/">Cloudflare</a>,

language-values-why-rust = Why Rust?

language-values-performance = Performance
language-values-performance-blurb = Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or
          garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on
          embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

language-values-reliability = Reliability
language-values-reliability-blurb = Rustâ€™s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety
          and thread-safety &mdash; and enable you to eliminate many classes of
          bugs at compile-time.

language-values-productivity = Productivity
language-values-productivity-blurb = Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error
          messages, and top-notch tooling &mdash; an integrated package manager
          and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and 
          type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
