  <h3>Rust is a compiled programming language that values performance, thread and memory safety, and developer productivity.</h3>
  <p>
            Rust provides a strong <strong>safety net</strong>, with the compiler
        guaranteeing the absence of many classes of bugs, for example those
        stemming from memory safety issues. Its type system allows it to achieve
        this <strong>without a garbage collector</strong> or a run time, so it
        can deliver the <strong>highest level of performance</strong>, and work
        on small devices or embedded into other languages. Rust's compiler gives
        great error messages, and when paired with Rust's great documentation,
        provides an excellent (and ever-improving) developer experience.
