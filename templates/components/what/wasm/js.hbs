                    The dream of WebAssembly is not to kill JavaScript but to work
                    alongside of it, to help super charge processing-heavy or low-level
                    tasks &mdash; tasks that benefit from Rust’s focus on performance.

                    Publish Rust WebAssembly packages to package registries like npm.
                    Bundle and ship them with webpack, Parcel, and others.
                    Maintain them with tools like <code>npm audit</code> and Greenkeeper.

                    Automatically generate binding code between Rust, WebAssembly, and JavaScript APIs.
                    Take advantage of libraries like <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/index.html"><code>web-sys</code></a>
                    that
                    provide pre-packaged bindings for the entire web platform.
